# Advent of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. Read more about it [https://adventofcode.com/about](here).

[[_TOC_]]

## Using

Build whichever years you want using CMake. Go to [coverage](#coverage) to see what solutions I've implemented.

```cmake
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -t 2021
```

The executables expect the input to be provided inside the corresponding file in `inputs/year/DayXX.txt`. Alternatively, you can provide the input file as an argument.

```
./build/2021/Day01 input.txt
```
